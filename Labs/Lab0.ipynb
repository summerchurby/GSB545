This should, in essence, be the minimum salary you need to afford the life you could live happily (you could probably survive on less, but let's not get too detailed here). Be careful to consider whether you're taking taxes into account! We don't need to get too detailed here either, but you should try to estimate what your actual take-home pay is versus the gross salary that you might be presented with in the offer from your employer.\n",

This is where the bulk of your computations for this assignment will be, and you may need to do some research into how these things are computed. Your job may have retirement funding built into it; it may not. Additionally, there are some calculators online that do some of these types of calculations for you. I'd like you to (re-)do these calculations as much as possible on your own in Python.\n",
