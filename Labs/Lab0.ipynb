Business Analytics because I wanted to gain specific skills, and I also did research on the salary that is expected of people that work in that specific industry. I had applied to a handful of universities in California and decided to pick Cal Poly because of the Learn by Doing motto. I had completed my undergrad degree the spring semester before the MSBA program started, and I completed a B.S. Business Administration degree with a double major in Marketing and Management with a Business Analytics minor. While in undergrad, I had 5 different internships during the course of summer breaks and during the school year."
