    "You should compare AdaBoost to at least one of the following: a bagging model, a stacking model.\n",
    "Based on the visualizations seen at the links above you're probably also thinking that this classification task should not be that difficult. So, a secondary goal of this assignment is to test the effects of the AdaBoost function arguments on the algorithm's performance. \n",
    "You should explore at least 3 different sets of settings for the function inputs, and you should do your best to find values for these inputs that actually change the results of your modelling. That is, try not to run three different sets of inputs that result in the same performance. The goal here is for you to better understand how to set these input values yourself in the future. Comment on what you discover about these inputs and how the behave.\n",
    "Your submission should be built and written with non-experts as the target audience. All of your code should still be included, but do your best to narrate your work in accessible ways."
